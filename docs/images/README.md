## Screenshot Guidelines

- **Resolution**: Use high-resolution screenshots (1920x1080 or higher)
- **Format**: Save as PNG for best quality
- **File size**: Keep under 500KB if possible
- **Content**: Focus on the relevant UI elements, crop unnecessary areas
- **Consistency**: Use the same VS Code theme across all screenshots

## Alternative: Using Placeholder Images

If you don't have the screenshots yet, you can:
1. Use placeholder images with descriptive text
2. Remove the image references from the main README
3. Add the screenshots later when the extension is fully functional
